                <p>Andrew Michael Cohen's career has run the gamut of theatre, especially while involved in ABO Productions. As a founding member he was both an actor and a director for "A Very Potter Musical". Having to devote his summer to studies in NYC, he wasn't available as a full time consultant for "Where's Waldo: The Musical", but he did help with casting and with the production process by serving as a producer. During the winter, Andrew produced and organized "A Broadway Cabaret Night" which helped to debut ABO Production's horizons. He now studies Music Theatre and Theatre Production at NYU's Steinhardt School.</p>

                <p>Hello! I am Ben McLaughlin and I'm so proud to be a board member of ABO. I have been theater since I was a young kid and have loved growing with these great people. Some of my theatrical highlights include being cast as Evelyn in production of Anything Goes, Lewis in Pippin, and J.B. Biggley in the show How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying. I was an original member of ABO in their first show, A Very Potter Musical in which I played the role of Voldemort. I was also involved in writing directing and acting in the most recent production, Where's Waldo: The Musical. I'm so excited to see where ABO will go and I'm honored to be working with such talented people.</p>
