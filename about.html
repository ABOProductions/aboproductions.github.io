Nicole first worked with ABO for the first production, <i>A Very Potter Musical</i> (Draco Malfoy).

                <p>Trey Hennessy is just one of the colorful cast of characters who make up the student leadership in ABO productions. He is currently studying Secondary Education Social Studies at Kutztown University with minors in History and Political Science. Trey has a different perspective than almost all of the other board members because he is not a performer and has always preferred the technical and production side of theatres. He was involved with many shows including ABO’s Where’s Waldo? And CB South’s Phantom of the Opera. He has recently taken interest in writing with his friend Jack Peters and hopes to showcase their work at a future date.</p>
